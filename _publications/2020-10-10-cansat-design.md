excerpt: "I'm currently working on this undergraduate research, about Cansat Design (can sized pico-satellite), which aims to become a standard in future national university competitions. It involves developing a robust prototype satellite and water rocket to launch it and recieve telemetry at a ground station, also deploying its parachute when maximum altitude is reached. Its system is based on Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Python."
