<div style="text-align: justify">
  I am an undergraduate student of Mechanical Engineering (Major in Robotics) at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de
  Chile. The areas that I like the most on this field are, design of robotic systems, adaptive control and
  biomechatronics. I play with electronics as my hobby, but I also spend my free time hiking, riding my bike, juggling
  and doing photography. In my projects I look for new challenges in order to expand my knowledge and expertise.
  I have done undergraduate research about CanSat (can sized pico-satellite) Design as a standard for future national 
  competitions, and Finite Elements Method implementation in torsion, bending and tensile tests in a Python enviroment
  using the NGSolve library. You can check my projects down here or in the <em>Projects</em> section.
