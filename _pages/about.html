<div style="text-align: justify">
  I am an undergraduate student of Mechanical Engineering (Major in Robotics) at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. The areas that I like the most on this field are, design of robotic systems, adaptive control and biomechatronics. I play with electronics as my hobby, but I also spend my free time hiking, riding my bike, juggling and doing photography. In my projects I look for new challenges in order to expand my knowledge and expertise. Currently, I am doing an undergraduate research in CanSat (can sized pico-satellite) Design that aims to build a path for future national competitions. You can check my projects down here or in the <em>Projects</em> section.
